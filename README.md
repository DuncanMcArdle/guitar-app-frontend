# Guitar app (front-end)
The guitar app is a small React application designed to aid with learning and memorising guitar chords. The idea behind the app is that you select a series of chords you wish to memorise, and then spend the chosen amount of time switching between those chords (in an order determined by the app).

## Technologies
Guitar app is a React application, written in TypeScript, which uses Redux throughout.

## Future functionality
A number of functionality pieces are in the process of being implemented, including but not limited to:
- Custom chords, saved via a Node.js backend to a personal account
- An optional visual representation of the requested chord
- Multi-lingual functionality
- End-to-end testing (currently only component-level testing is implemented)
